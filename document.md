The analysis involves data collection, cleaning, and visualization to identify key factors contributing to turnover.MethodologyData Acquisition and PreparationSource: The dataset was initially obtained in CSV format.Conversion: For easier editing and manipulation, the CSV file was converted into Excel format.Data Cleaning: A thorough review of the dataset was conducted to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved checking for missing values, outliers, and incorrect entries.Data Analysis with Power BIOnce cleaned, the data was imported into Power BI for comprehensive analysis.An interactive dashboard was created with filters such as:DepartmentGenderMarital StatusAge BandAppropriate graphs were used to visualize findings clearly.Key FindingsThe analysis revealed several important trends:Many employees tend to leave the company within their first year.The 24-34 age band group has the highest attrition rate.Most departing employees have less than one year of experience at the company.The first five years are crucial for retaining employees.Proposed SolutionsBased on these insights, recommendations were made to improve retention:Implementing a mentorship program for new hiresPreferentially recruiting candidates with more than one year of work experienceRegular check-ins on new employeesEstablishing a feedback mechanism to address issues proactivelyTools UsedMicrosoft Excel for initial data manipulationPower BI for data visualization and analysisConclusionThis project provides actionable insights into attrition patterns using Power BI's interactive visualizations. Recommendations derived from this study can be implemented by HR departments to enhance employee retention strategies.Future WorkFuture iterations could involve integrating additional datasets or exploring predictive analytics models using machine learning techniques in Power BI or other tools like Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).
