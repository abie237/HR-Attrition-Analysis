Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the primary causes of employee attrition within a company. The analysis involves data collection, cleaning, and visualization to identify key factors contributing to turnover.

Methodology
Data Acquisition and Preparation

Source: The dataset was initially obtained in CSV format.

Conversion: For easier editing and manipulation, the CSV file was converted into Excel format.

Data Cleaning: A thorough review of the dataset was conducted to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved checking for missing values, outliers, and incorrect entries.

Data Analysis with Power BI

Once cleaned, the data was imported into Power BI for comprehensive analysis.

An interactive dashboard was created with filters such as:

Department

Gender

Marital Status

Age Band

Appropriate graphs were used to visualize findings clearly.

Key Findings

The analysis revealed several important trends:

Many employees tend to leave the company within their first year.

The 24-34 age band group has the highest attrition rate.

Most departing employees have less than one year of experience at the company.

The first five years are crucial for retaining employees.

Proposed Solutions

Based on these insights, recommendations were made to improve retention:

Implementing a mentorship program for new hires

Preferentially recruiting candidates with more than one year of work experience

Regular check-ins on new employees

Establishing a feedback mechanism to address issues proactively

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel for initial data manipulation

Power BI for data visualization and analysis

Conclusion
This project provides actionable insights into attrition patterns using Power BI's interactive visualizations. Recommendations derived from this study can be implemented by HR departments to enhance employee retention strategies.

Future Work
Future iterations could involve integrating additional datasets or exploring predictive analytics models using machine learning techniques in Power BI or other tools like Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).
